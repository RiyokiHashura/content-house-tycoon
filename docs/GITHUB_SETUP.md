# GitHub Repository Setup

## ðŸš€ Creating the Repository

Since GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these steps to set up the remote repository:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click "+" in the top right â†’ "New repository"
3. Repository name: `content-house-tycoon`
4. Description: `Professional Roblox tycoon game featuring content creator simulation with hybrid casual gameplay mechanics`
5. Make it **Public** (for collaboration)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Option 2: Connect Existing Repository
Once the GitHub repo is created, run these commands in terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/content-house-tycoon.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## ðŸ“‹ Repository Configuration

### Branch Protection (Recommended)
- Set `main` as the default branch
- Enable branch protection rules:
  - Require pull request reviews
  - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
  - Require status checks to pass

### Collaboration Settings
- Add collaborators if working with a team
- Set up appropriate permissions (Write access for developers)

### Repository Secrets (For Future CI/CD)
- `ROBLOX_API_KEY` (when implementing automated testing)
- Any other sensitive configuration

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/stream-controller

# Make your changes...
# Test in Roblox Studio...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Implement stream controller with orb generation"
git push origin feature/stream-controller

# Create PR on GitHub
# Merge after review
```

### Commit Message Convention
```
feat: implement hype stream core loop
fix: resolve plot assignment edge case
docs: update architecture documentation
test: add plot manager unit tests
refactor: simplify data service error handling
```

## ðŸ“Š Issues and Project Management

### GitHub Issues
Create issues for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Technical debt
- Documentation updates

### Labels to Create
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to docs
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `mvp` - Critical for minimum viable product
- `phase-1` - Part of initial development phase

### Milestones
1. **MVP Phase 1** - Basic gameplay loop working
2. **Content Expansion** - Additional content types
3. **Polish & Optimization** - Performance and UX improvements
4. **Launch Ready** - Full feature set complete

## ðŸš€ Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **Push Current Code**: Get the architecture committed
2. **Create Issues**: Break down remaining work into tasks
3. **Set Milestones**: Track progress toward MVP
4. **Invite Collaborators**: If working with others
5. **Start Development**: Begin Phase 1 implementation

The repository is now ready for professional development with proper version control and collaboration features!
